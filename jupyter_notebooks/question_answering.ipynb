      "No. The answer to the question 'Does SOX2 regulate TP53?' is 'No'. This conclusion is supported by evidence from multiple sources. One study found that mutations in TP53 increase the risk of SOX2 copy number alterations, but there was no evidence of SOX2 regulating TP53 (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780934). Another study showed that loss of TP53 function promotes lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer through increased expression of SOX2, but there was no mention of SOX2 regulating TP53 (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28059768). Additionally, a study on astrocytomas found a positive correlation between ID4 and SOX2 expression levels, but did not mention any regulation between SOX2 and TP53 (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613880). Another study on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma identified potential functional partners of SOX2, including TP53, but did not provide evidence of direct regulation between the two (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705224). Finally, a study on medulloblastoma showed that Sox2+ cells resist p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest response, but did not mention any regulation between SOX2 and TP53 (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31763624). Therefore, based on the available evidence, it\n"
